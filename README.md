# Map Coloring Course Project
This is a course project for the subject **Data Structures** (2nd semester, 1st year, Information Security).  
The goal is to implement and visualize a **Map Coloring Problem** using the C language and OpenGL.

The project aims to simulate the classic graph coloring task — assigning colors to regions on a map so that no two adjacent regions share the same color.

**Technology stack:**
- Programming Language: C
- Visualization: OpenGL
- IDE: VS Code
- Version Control: Git + GitHub

*Documentation Files:**
- `README.md` — General project description and structure
- `theory.md` — Key theoretical background (graph coloring, planar graphs, 4-color theorem, etc.)
- `algorithms.md` — Description of the algorithms used (brute force, greedy, DSATUR, backtracking)
